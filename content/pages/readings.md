For every class period, there will be core readings that we will all complete and then an additional set of "Rabbit Hole" readings/activities for your continued exploration. Graduate students will be required to do at least one of these additional readings/activities.

Identify a potential user/consumer of your mini-project. Share your prototype with an individual or group of individuals that most genuinely reflects your intended user. In your design journal, describe the user feedback (preferably in visual form) and how you incorporated it into subsequent iterations of your mini-project.
